love the way you lie
i cant tell you what it really is 
i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there is a steel knife in my windpipe

and as long as the wrong feels right, its like i am in flight
high off her love drunk from her hate 
its like i am huffing paint and i love her the more i suffocate



damnnnnn


i want to add few more.
the camera adds 10 pounds . 
then how many cameras are on you.
